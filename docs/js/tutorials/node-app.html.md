## Before we get started

This tutorial continues after "[Getting Started][started]" - so you should have seen Danger comment on your PRs.

## "Node App"

A node app could cover anything from an API, to a website, a native app or a hardware project. The rules on these
projects tend to come from your larger dev team culture. In [Artsy][] a lot of our rules for applications come from
trying to have a similar culture between all projects.

## Assignees

We use [a slack bot][no-slacking] to let people know when they've been assigned to a PR, and so the first rule added to
an app is a check that there are assignees to your PR. This is a really simple check:

```js
import { danger, fail, warn } from "danger"

if (!danger.github.pr.assignee) {
  fail("This pull request needs an assignee, and optionally include any reviewers.")
}
```

The `danger.pr` object is the JSON provided by GitHub to [represent a pull request][pr]. So here we're pulling out the
`assignee` key and validating that anything is inside it.

We can make a small improvement to this rule, by allowing someone to declare that a PR is a "work in progress" Danger
can allow the build to pass, but will provide feedback that there is no assignee.

```js
import { danger, fail, warn } from "danger"

if (!danger.github.pr.assignee) {
  const method = danger.github.pr.title.includes("WIP") ? warn : fail
  method("This pull request needs an assignee, and optionally include any reviewers.")
}
```

Using a function as a variable we can determine whether to fail, or warn based on whether the PR's title includes the
string `"WIP"`.

## PR Messages

In a similar vein, we also want to encourage pull requests as a form of documentation. We can help push people in this
direction by not allowing the body of a pull request to be less than a few characters long.

```js
if (danger.github.pr.body.length < 10) {
  fail("This pull request needs a description.")
}
```

This can be expanded to all sorts of checks for example:

- Making sure every PR references an issue, or JIRA ticket.
- Skipping particular rules based on what someone says inside the message. E.g. "This is a trivial PR." - in Artsy we
  allow particular hashtags to suppress feedback from danger.

## Results of CI Processes

Let's assume you're using CI for running tests or linters.

```yaml
script:
  - yarn lint
  - yarn test
  - yarn danger ci
```

If your tool does not have an extra log file output option, you can look at using [`tee`][tee] to copy the text output
into a file for later reading ( so you'd change `- yarn lint` to `yarn lint | tee 'linter.log'` )

And here's a really simple check that it contains the word "Failed" and to post the logs into the PR.

```js
import { danger, markdown } from "danger"

import contains from "lodash-contains"
import fs from "fs"

const testFile = "tests-output.log"
const linterOutput = fs.readFileSync(testFile).toString()

if (contains(linterOutput, "Failed")) {
  markdown(`These changes failed to pass the linter:
${linterOutput}
  `)
}
```

More mature tools may have a JSON output reporter, so you can parse that file and create your own report for danger to
post.

If you build something that is a generic wrapper around a specific linting tool, this is a great place to convert that
code [into a plugin][plugin] so that anyone can use it. In this case, Danger effectively is a way of moving these
messages into the code review session.
